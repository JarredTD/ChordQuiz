## Introduction
This is a simple script that I use to randomly sift through a text-file containing chord names. The script will simply display the name of the chord, and wait for 'enter' to be hit. Upon hitting enter, a new chord will display. This will continue until all chords have been displayed.

## Dependencies
The script does not use and external libraries. Currently, it only uses 'random' to assist in 'randomly' selecting a chord to display

## Future Plans
Currently, the script is in a bare-bones state for simple functionality, some future features could be:

- Simple Menu
- More text-files containing groupings of chords (lessons/specific practice)
- Dynamically search for text-files to allow for custom groupings
- Options to show chord framing
